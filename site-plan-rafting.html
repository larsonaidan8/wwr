    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Here at Dry Oar White Water Rafting our purpose is to get all of the people that are thrill seeking and in desperate need of an amazing time to come and try out our adventure. On this trip you will experience things that you would otherwise never have the chance to experience in your lifetime. It will be fun but not easy, this adventure is not for everyone. Some parts will be very hard while others will be more relaxed and chilled. This trip has a good ratio of exciting and fun things to relaxed and break times. </p>
